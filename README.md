**Project Structure & Project Idea:** Event Management System
**Description:** Build a web-based Event Management System that allows users to create, manage, and attend events. This project can serve individuals, organizations, or businesses looking to streamline their event planning processes.
****Key Features:**
**User Roles:**
Admin: Manage users, events, and categories.
Organizer: Create and manage events, view analytics.
Attendee: Browse events, register, and provide feedback.
Event Creation and Management:

Organizers can create events with details like date, time, location, and description.
Option to upload images, set ticket prices, and manage capacity.
Registration and Ticketing:

Attendees can register for events and purchase tickets.
QR code generation for tickets for easy check-in.
Event Discovery:

Browse events by categories (e.g., workshops, conferences, social gatherings).
Filter events by date, location, or price.
Notifications and Reminders:

Email notifications for event updates and reminders for upcoming events.
Feedback and Ratings:

Attendees can leave feedback and rate events after attendance.
Admin Dashboard:

Analytics for organizers, including ticket sales, attendee numbers, and feedback.
Tech Stack:
Backend:

Java with Spring Boot for RESTful APIs.
Frontend:

React or Angular for a dynamic user interface.
Database:

PostgreSQL or MongoDB for data storage.
Deployment:

Deploy the application using Heroku or AWS.
Additional Features to Consider:
Social Media Integration: Allow users to share events on social platforms.
Payment Gateway: Integrate a payment solution (e.g., Stripe or PayPal) for ticket sales.
Mobile Responsiveness: Ensure the platform is accessible on mobile devices.
Step 1: Backend (Spring Boot)

Spring Web
Spring Data JPA
PostgreSQL Driver (or H2 for simplicity)
Spring Security (optional, for user authentication)
Why This Project Stands Out:
Real-World Application: Event management is relevant across industries, making this project applicable to various job roles.
User Engagement: The combination of user roles, event creation, and feedback mechanisms demonstrates your understanding of user experience.
Technical Diversity: Involves backend and frontend development, database management, and possibly payment integration, showcasing a wide range of skills.

Final:
Developed the code and the files are attached and documentation is done for showcasing the technical abilities and also highlights the problem solving skills and understanding of user needs.Creating a complete Event Management System involves a lot of code, but I can provide a simplified version to help you get started. This will include the basic structure for the backend (using Spring Boot) and a simple frontend (using React).
